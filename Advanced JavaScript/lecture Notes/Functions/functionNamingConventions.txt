A few things to remember when naming functions:
1) Name functions after a verb which clearly conveys what they do
2) Omit articles (a, an)
3) Make sure the name matches the number of items involved (createTodo vs createTodos)
4) Verb at the beginning, noun at the end (checkCompleteTodo)
5) If you have similar actions throughout the application, use the same verb to describe them
