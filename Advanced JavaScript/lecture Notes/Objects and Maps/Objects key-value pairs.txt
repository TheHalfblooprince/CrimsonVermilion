Objects are used to store unchanging, key:value data.
Think of variables as boxes and objects as file cabinets. Keys are names of files, values are the contents of files.
Keys can only be strings, but values can be any data type, including other objects (nested objects): ```js { key: {
key: 'value' 
} }
Objects can also include functions:
```js
{
  sayHi() {
    console.log('hi')  
  }
}
