            My name is Muhammad Wasi Ul Haq, I am going to ve a billionare one day and help the people who are in need.
            I will take care of my family and friends and provide them with whatever I could to do so. I hope that all the 
            violence in the world comes to an end and people decide to live in peace and harmony with each other. I hope that
            all the Muslims in the world remain tangled into each others arms. I hope that the world will learn to love again.
            That is my dream. The dream of Rana Muhammad Wasi Ul Haq.
